# Backend Review and Testing Plan

## Information Gathered
- Backend is a Django REST API for room/space management system with JWT authentication.
- Apps: usuarios, espacios, reservas, llaves, incidencias, objetos, notificaciones.
- Uses DRF, simplejwt, PostgreSQL database.
- Docker Compose setup for db (Postgres) and web (Django).
- Test scripts: test_jwt.py (login test), test_endpoints.py (API endpoint tests).
- No Django unit tests in apps/tests.py files.
- URLs configured with router for API endpoints under /api/.

## Plan
- Start Docker Compose services to run database and web server.
- Verify migrations are applied.
- Run test_jwt.py to test JWT token obtain.
- Run test_endpoints.py to test various API endpoints (GET, POST, token refresh).
- Monitor for errors, status codes, and response data.

## Dependent Files
- None (testing existing functionality).

## Followup Steps
- Analyze test results.
- If tests pass, backend is working.
- If failures, identify and fix issues (e.g., database connection, authentication, endpoint logic).
- Optionally, implement Django unit tests for better coverage.

## Current Status
- Backend fully tested and working with provided PostgreSQL schema.
- Docker services running successfully.
- JWT authentication working.
- All API endpoints responding correctly (GET, POST, etc.).
- Read-only access without token, authenticated access with token.
- Database created with full schema including roles, users, spaces, reservations, keys, incidents, lost objects, notifications, etc.
- Users created and database populated.
- All tests pass.
- API accessible at http://localhost:8000/api/
